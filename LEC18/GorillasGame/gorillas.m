% Set some initial parameters
w = 12; % widith of a buuilding in meters
N = 10; % nnumber of buildings in the stage
minHeight = 10; % minimum building height
maxHeight = 75; % maximum building height

% Set up the stage by creating a bar chart (10 bars, each 12 units wide)
[stageX, stageY] = setstage(w, N, minHeight, maxHeight);

% Randomly positioning players (gorillas)
[player1X, player1Y, player2X, player2Y] = setplayers(stageX, stageY);


% Player 1 shoots a banana
[a0, v0] = getinputs(true);

% possible x values for player 1's projectile. 
x = linspace(player1X, max(stageX)); % towards east

% calculating y values of the projectile
y = projectile(x, player1X, player1Y, a0, v0);

plot(x,y,'r-');


% Player 2 shoots a banana
[a0, v0] = getinputs(false);

% possible x values for player 2's projectile. 
x = linspace(player2X, min(stageX)); % towards the west

% calculating y values of the projectile
y = projectile(x, player2X, player2Y, a0, v0);

plot(x,y,'b-');
